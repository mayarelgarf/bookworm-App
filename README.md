# MY FINAL PROJECT

my app is a smaller version of goodreads where the user can search for a book , displays all reviews and add his own review. 
while the admin can delete or update reviews.
ps. the admin username is: "admin" , password : '123456'


- What does it do?  
  "This is a web project which displays books and can add review as a user or manage the users reviewes from admin page"

- What is the "new feature" which you have implemented that we haven't seen before?  
  the admin can delete or edit the reviews

## Prerequisites
Did you add any additional modules that someone needs to install (for instance anything in Python that you `pip install-ed`)? 
List those here (if any).
